# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Design**: Simple, recognizable design that represents bookmark management
- **Colors**: Use the same blue color scheme as the extension (#1a73e8)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software like:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- GIMP
- Canva

Or use online icon generators that can export to multiple sizes.

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons ready, you can:
1. Use any placeholder images temporarily
2. Remove the icons section from `manifest.json` (the extension will still work)
3. Create simple text-based icons using CSS
